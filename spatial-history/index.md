<h1 style="color:pink"> The Streets of Victoria's Chinatown </h1>

The spatial concentration of Victoria’s historical Chinatown located within the four blocks between Johnson Street to Herald Street in British Columbia, has significant implications that extend beyond simply existing within a junction. I will discuss how the geographical positioning of Victoria’s Chinatown relates to the sociopolitical manipulations of the government and the dominant society defining and confining where and for whom space can develop [^1].

<h1 style="color:white"> Arriving to Victoria </h1>

Firstly, the reason significant numbers of early Chinese immigrants arrived in Victoria, British Columbia and formed Chinatown was due to the manipulations of the colonial administration to control the process of labor migration and assert their political authority.  The 1856 discovery of Gold in the __Thompson River__, a tributary of __Fraser River__, and subsequently in the Fraser River itself, drew tens of thousands of migrant workers from around the world to British Columbia.  In response to the Gold Rush, the Island’s British Governor, James Douglas, designated __Fort Victoria__ as the sole port of entry into British Columbia, making it necessary for all who wished to reach __Fort Langley__, the major link to the goldfields, to detour through the newly established city and headquarters of western portion of the Hudson Bay Company [^2].  This was done to eliminate the uncontrolled traffic at Fort Langley and to ensure the fortune seekers entering British Columbia had to register their trading licenses, pay entry fees, commercial taxes, duties, and other governmental provisions on the importing and exporting of goods [^3]. As well as to assert British sovereignty over the British Columbia amid the large entries of American miners and laborers into the Fraser area from Washington that made the administration fear a possible American takeover [^4].


This political intervention ensured that the first hundreds of Chinese merchants and laborers arriving and entering the British colony for the Gold Rush would be by way of Victoria, British Columbia.  Additionally, the decision to funnel migrants through Victoria not only placed the Chinese in Victoria, it gave them the reason to stay. Though most migrants promptly moved north to work in the goldfields, the large influx of migrants entering the Island called for the provisional setup of small tent communities while laborers had to obtain their mining licenses and equipment in accordance to the Island’s provisions [^5]. This subsequently caused many immigrants to permanently stay in Victoria and engage in land development work. This allowed many Chinese migrants to remain in Victoria and establish businesses to serve the rising population of Victoria.  Significantly, the administrative decision to make Victoria the sole port of entry, led to concentration of Chinese settlers in Victoria, which in turn, transitioned into the creation of Chinatown near Fort Victoria.

<h1 style="color:white"> Settling on Johnson and Cormorant </h1>

Secondly, Chinatown’s settlement in the northern portion of Victoria, British Columbia, had sociopolitical significances related to the Chinese experience, as migrant workers who worked in previous “white industries” that defined particular lands as out of bounds.  When the Chinese migrants arrived, very little option for land availability was present. The white occupants had resided on the hillsides on the west, as well as in the south part of Victoria on Humboldt Street, directly below Fort Street.  Additionally, the southeastern part of the city had been saturated by the Jewish community on Johnson Street [^6]. In reaction to the spatial arena presented, informal suasion led for the Chinese migrants to settle in a tent community away from white settlers and closer to the Jewish community. The choice of geographic position for the Chinese community was intensively a defense reaction arising from previous experiences in British Colony’s racist social and political climate.  The Chinese migrants arriving during the Gold Rush had experienced or were made aware of experiences of violence against Chinese workers amid migrant labor and settlement in western regions. Specifically, many of the Chinese migrants arriving in Victoria had come directly from California where white miners were robbing, murdering and driving Chinese miners from the goldfields [^7].  Thus, as the tendency for racism and violence arise between white workers and Chinese workers had resonated with the Chinese community, a collective desire to settle away from white settlers and to remain an unimposing presence in Victoria.  As a result, the Chinese migrants found themselves on the north bank of __Johnson Street__ settled on the unappealing mudflats near the fringe of the business centre that was considered bad land [^8]. This initial settlement would trend northward away from the white locus and onto __Cormorant Street__ (today’s Pandora Street), the undeveloped land above Johnson Street and the __Johnson Street ravine__(no longer exists). The width of this development would be determined by the footbridges across the ravine on the streets of __Store, Government and Douglas Street__ [^9].  These settlements would become the ‘embryo’ of Victoria’s Chinatown for the current and arriving Chinese migrants as Chinese merchants purchased lots of lands on Cormorant Street in 1858 and built many wooden shacks for housing and stores that continued the development of Chinatown northwards away from the increasingly discriminatory arena developing in Victoria.

<h1 style="color:white"> Northward Expansion </h1>

Chinatown’s expansion beyond this initial settlement is reflective of an exclusionary sociopolitical climate that vilified and ostracized the Chinese settler in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. To the white laborer, the presence of the Chinese laborers and the further recruitment of Chinese labor for industry developments made the Chinese settler a presumed enemy to the economic opportunities of white laborers. Consequently, anti-oriental sentiments such as that “each successful Chinese meant the failure of one white worker” [^10], fostered an increasingly exclusive Victoria society that had marked fundamental places and structures as ‘white territory’ and ‘white domain’. This socioeconomic stance was furthered by the political denouncing of Chinese settlers as “inferior” and unsuitable citizens [^11].  This ideology was intensified when British Columbia officially joined the confederation of Canada in 1871 and sought to make the Province more British through having ‘loyal subjects” to the Crown as its residents; in other words, lessening the Chinese presence. These sentiments about Chinese settlers would spearhead a series of political provisions and social exclusion acts to alienate and shrink the Chinese community by discouraging the further entry of Chinese migrants into Canada and removing citizenship and access to Canadian structures. [^12]


Consequently, Chinatown was created utilizing the tight spatial arena of their initial settlement to create and develop their own institutions, businesses and entertainment centers to accommodate for the exclusionary tendencies of the host society. It would be these adaptive developments of these structures and institutions, made during the legislative and social othering of the Chinese community, which determined the specific location of Victoria’s Chinatown today.  The most significant organization to push the spatial location of Chinatown was the configuration of the transnational __Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association__ (CCBA) in Victoria. The CCBA worked to united the factions of the Chinese community and promote closeness, dispute resolutions, aid for the poor and sick and defense against domestic oppression through legislation, exercising jurisdiction, and enforcing orders to protect the Chinese in the country [^13].  In opposition to exclusion from primary Canadian structures the CCBA made two instrumental institutions for the Chinese community. Firstly, the made the hospital; after operating a __Chinese Hospital__ from the top floor of the CCBA at 554 – 562 Fisgard Street from 1885, they finally established the Chinese Hospital on 555 __Herald Street__ for Chinese people who were refused aid at the local hospital in 1899 [^14].  Additionally, in 1907, when Chinese youths were barred from entering schools behind the protest of the Rock Bay School of Victoria based on “poor English skills”, and the Province’s claim to not need to educate anyone not born in Canada, the CCBA created the Le Qun Free School on the top floor of their headquarters, and later opened the __Imperial Chinese School__ at 636 Fisgard Street [^15].

As Chinese settlers were being barred from the white areas of Victoria, these Chinese structures became primary features of everyday life. The promotion of community and togetherness, helped with the formation of social organizations between fellow Chinese migrants from the same clan, faction and religions societies which resulted in the pooling of money, or merchant sponsorships to create society buildings for Chinese consumption on Cormorant and **Fisgard** as well.  As the placement of organizations and CCBA structures persisted on Cormorant and Fisgard Street, and the Chinese community continued to acquire land around these undesirable Chinese structures, the living, business and entertainment districts on and behind these streets would become an intricate settlement of interlocking passageways and allies were newcomers would enter to register with the CCBA and find homes, where kids would walk to go to school, where clan members would attend their organizational buildings and where the hidden entertainment and vice sectors were hidden [^16]. This securely established the four blocks from Johnson Street to Herald between Government and Store Street with a distinct _italics_“Chineseness”_italics_ [^17] that has now been nationally recognized as Victoria’s Chinatown.

<h1 style="color:white"> Closing </h1>
Therefore, it is clear that the sociopolitical climate of Vancouver Island largely precipitated the spatial existence of Victoria’s Chinatown. The British administration of the Island drew the Chinese migrants to Victoria by making the way of entry into the Island though Victoria. Furthermore, the oversaturation of migrants caused by the manipulation of migration passages, gave Chinese migrants the opportunity to settle and establish businesses in the local economy rather than continuing onwards to the goldfields.  Additionally, racial tensions and suasion drew the Chinese into a specific geographic location in an attempt to create distance between themselves and the white settlers.  And lastly, the expansion Chinatown was largely influenced from the legislative manipulations to restrict Chinese settlers from enjoying white domains and forcing them to create their own institutions, businesses and structures, enabling the northern expansion of Chinatown in its own separated and resilient domain.
