Sonia May Malkine had lived under the oppressive regime of the Nazi Germany and Vichy Government collaboration in France from 1940 - 1944. In an interview, Malkine discusses her perception of how the French resistance and German occupation developed in the France and how it had impacted her fellow citizens and herself living under the Nazi Germany and Vichy Government regime. This essay further indulges in the happenings of the war, and expands upon Malkine's sentiments that the French resistance was a bottom-up movement that originating from the citizens and moving outwardly to receive external assistance.




On June 25th, 1940, the Vichy Government of France signed the Franco-German Armistice, subsequently confirming France’s immediate surrender and cooperation with Hitler’s Nazi‑Germany after falling to the German Blitzkrieg, a new German military tactic for invading and occupying countries that had allowed the German Army to take over the capital of Paris and other parts of France’s Metropolitan in a mere six weeks during the Battle of France. [^1] The occupation of Germany marked France’s shift from the side of the “Allied” countries who were siding with Britain in the Second World War to the side of the “Axis Powers”, on Germany’s side, as France’s Vichy Government became a willing collaborator to the German’s schemes regarding the occupation of Germany. It would be the German’s and Vichy Government’s partnership that would cost the country justice and economic vitality thus leading to a tyrannical period in France’s history that had invoked the French resistance.

As suggest by Malkine, the resistance did not immediately begin as Germany initially attempted to be civil and peaceful between themselves and the cooperating French Government and their civilians. And as a result, the buildup to the resistance took time to sprout. Often symbolically, the start of the French resistance is referred to as happening on June 18, 1940, after the Military General, Charles de Gaulle, announced over the BBC airways in London Britain, that the “flame of French resistance will not be extinguished,” [^2] prompting French citizens to revolt against the Vichy Government’s and the Nazi‑German’s occupation. However, not many heard or desired to respond to his plea. This happened for many reasons, but mainly persisted on the desire of the French society to get back to continuity and civility of life, rather than engage in another war after the loss in the Battle of France. Thus, the call to resist had fallen on “deaf ears”, [^3] motivating little to no resistance.


However, as the injustices became too burdensome, the need for resistance arose within the country as “all illusions have vanished” [^4] about allowing the Franco‑German relation to be maintained for the benefit of the French society. This was a direct result of France undergoing very cruel and undesirable changes that promoted a new sociopolitical climate for the French citizens to resist the Vichy Government and the German occupants. The motivations for resistance were plentiful as the French came to “resent” the German occupation and as described in the interview by Sonia May Malkine the rising resentment surrounded issues of increased restrictions placed on the French citizens, the mistreatment of the Jewish populations, and the depletion of French resources and labor force.

Firstly, France became increasingly legislated and confined in order to promote German regimes. This was represented by the dividing of French territory into two zones. The upper portion of France was referred to as the occupied zone which was completely under German control, and the free zone theoretically under the control of the Vichy Government where life was meant to continue much as before, however, was also under German rule and came to have strict definitions as to how the French could live their lives.[^5]  Furthermore, the implementation of Jewish laws and conditioned persecution beginning in December of 1940, which was leading to the displacement, death and mistreatment of Jewish citizens and minorities. And as mentioned by Malkine the increasing alienation of Jewish citizens considered “friends, family and neighbors” from the public sector and media, and the legislating for Jewish citizens to wear visible markers to designate them as separate from the rest of society became increasingly scrutinized in the French society.[^6]  Moreover, the Vichy Government had instated the Service du Travail Obligatoire (Compulsory Work Service, also known as “STO”) in which male French workers were being enlisted to work as force laborers in Germany to assist the wartime efforts and production within Germany, creating a hostile relationship between an unwillingly labor force and the Government.[^7] Then, in addition to that, the French resources were being depleted of food and commodities in order to bolster the regime in Germany, leaving many of the French citizens “starving”, and with true reimbursement for their merchandises as Germany were giving permission to purchase any of France’s produce and items with demonetized military dollars as discussed in the video.[^8]

With the issues, toppling on top of one another, this inspired the French to start small organizations to promote resistance rhetoric and create posters and materials enticing fellow citizens to push for liberation. From these issues alone, many underground groups’ push toward liberations began to arise among the French citizenry.


Additionally, the early resistance was most influenced by the breaching of the German and Russian Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of 1939 which had held Soviet Russia, the homeland of the communist party’s headquarters, and French Communist Party at bay in resisting Germany’s invasions of Europe, and France would create the most impactful resistance group in the war – The Communist.  The alliance was swiftly called off after Hitler invaded Russia in June of 1941. Effectively, after the invasion, the Communist Party would give the order to communist regimes throughout Europe to “resume the armed struggle” [^9] against Nazi-Germany and their spread. This lead to the creation of the strongest political resistance regime in France, the Franctireurs – Partisans (“FTP”) a communist clandestine branch comprised of French citizens carrying out secret plots of sabotage against the German and Vichy Government’s prowar and Nazi facilities and resources, producing false identity documents for the Jewish citizens to remain undetected and the secretive movement of secret agents, and supporting the upkeep of the underground organizations aimed at taking down the Franco-German collaboration.[^10] Therefore, the undemocratic practices of the Vichy Government in their collaborative order to work with Germany, and Germany’s attack on Russia was the push many needed to begin the resistance.

Nonetheless, through 1940 to the early portion of 1943, the primary means of resistance was evasion, as during this period the resistance altogether had not been forceful and intensively direct. Jewish citizens, minorities, militants, and laborers who sought to evade the racial laws set in place, and the Compulsory Labor Deportation to Germany, had neglected Government orders by hiding out in shacks far away from the central government. [^11] This predominantly related to the fact the subtle acts of  resistance would incur less severe punishments than the select few  found to be participating in the active resistance of sabotage and violence. For instance, in the interview by Malkine “if you were found within any type of weapon you were shot!” This lead to only a few joining members of the active resistance of sabotage and resistance fighters as a self – preservation tactic as national expectation for resistance success was low.


It would be major events outside of the Country of France that intensively changed the dynamics both within the resistance and the development of the Second World War and the liberating of France. This predominantly related to the entry of the Americans to the war on the side of the Allies after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the defeat of Germany in Russia.  The attack on the American Naval Base Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 7, 1941, drew the United States of America into the war and brought them to partner with the Allied Britain. [^12] This increased the allied powers immeasurably, and allowed the British and American armies to begin their campaign to remove German power from the countries they had occupied during the war. Secondly, and most significantly, the defeat of Germany in Stalingrad on February 2, 1943 following the previous invasion of Russia, and the subsequent defeat in Kursk in July changed the dynamics of the Second World War. [^13] These events helped place the favor in the hands of the Allies, and gave many of the French resistors in the country hope of success as Germany shifted from an undefeatable force to having the defeat of Germany becoming feasible worldwide. From this point forward, the active resistance gained more activists and many separated organizations developed in France from around this period.

Initially, as Malkine had stated the Germany and the Vichy Government “didn’t take it [the resistance]seriously until they saw it growing in every direction”. However, once the furiousness of the resistance caught the attention of the Vichy Government they attempted to cap the French resistance by creating the tyrannical parliamentary fascist militia called the “Milice”, which was a special court to trial presumed resistors and perform summary executions to quell the resistance and incite fear of disobedience to the state and Nazi-Germany. [^14] This was formed form the large percentage of the French citizenry that had opposed the resistance and had allowed their anti‑communist sentiments and anti–political activism to lead them to align with pro‑Vichy structure. However, the fire of the resistance pursued and this repression of the resistance led to greater cooperation and collaboration with the Allies and external government who were shocked by the large amount and power the resistance forces of France had come to create and immediately set about organizing and sharing those powers under the unified organization figurehead the Commission Militarie d’Action (“COMAC”). [^15] As mentioned by Malkine, the COMAC was organized by Jean Moulin, appointed official by Charles de Gaulle, that went to France and ordered the numerous and individualistic resistance group to lead the French Home Forces ("FFI") into the collaboration with the British and American military and secret services to arm the militants to help sabotage and fight on D-Day.


The beginning of the end would start to materialize on Friday 5, June 1944 when the BBC French station announced over the radios of the French resistors, that it was time to activate their plans of attack.  This was the night the fight of the resistance hit its apex and accounted for approximately 1,000 acts of sabotage, which, including the bombing of Nazi locomotives, bridges and routes used by the German Army, the derailment of trains that carried German reinforcements and resources to where the center of the battle would begin, on the beaches of Normandy. [^16]  Following the night of resistance, the Allied Armies began to arrive in droves and the long battle of removing the German occupants and Vichy Government ensued. By the end of 1944, nearly all German-Nazi occupants had been removed and the vigor of the resistance came to be celebrated by France as Paris had been liberated: “Liberated by its own efforts, liberated by its people with the help of the Armies of France, with the help of all of France, that is France in combat. The one France, the true France, eternal France.” [^17]

Therefore, just as Malkine discusses in her personal account of the war, the resistance was a creation of a nationalistic push against tyranny and for the liberation of the country from unbearable and provoking conditions. It would be the secret organizations and collaborations of the French citizens through a nationalistic drive that helped them remain and active part of taking down a French Government and Nazi-German regime that threatened to undo their democracy and stifle their liberties.
